# Company-Lay-Offs-Analysis
Welcome to the GitHub repository of a Layoff Data Analysis Project! This data analysis project is carried out in a Jupyter notebook and employs various data analytics techniques to explore the layoff events from different companies across various industries.

## About The Dataset
The data set that used for this project provides comprehensive insights into layoff events of different companies. The dataset is organized with the following

location: The geographical location where the company is based.

industry: The industry sector to which the company belongs.

total_laid_off: The total number of employees who were laid off in the event.

percentage_laid_off: The percentage of employees laid off from the total number of employees in the company.

date: The date when the layoff event occurred.

stage: The stage of the company, for example, startup, growth, mature.

country: The country where the company is based.

funds_raised: The total amount of funds that the company has raised to date.

## Jupyter Notebook
I have performed all of the analysis in a Jupyter Notebook environment, which provides a clean, interactive interface for conducting and presenting data analyses. This allows me to execute code in separate blocks while documenting our findings and explanations alongside, enhancing readability and understanding.

## Purpose of the Project
Understand trends in layoff events in different companies, locations, and industries
Identify relationships, if any, between company stage, funds raised, and layoff events
Understand how layoffs have been evolving over time
